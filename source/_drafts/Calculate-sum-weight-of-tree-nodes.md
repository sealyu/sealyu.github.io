## Questions:

Given a binary tree(Every node has a integer value including positive and negative int), get number of paths whose sum equal certain integer value. The start node and end node could from any nodes of the tree.
For example: Given a binary tree like below:

    {% asset_img binary-tree.png Binary Tree %}
    
Find number of paths whose nodes sum value equal 8.
           
## Solution:
